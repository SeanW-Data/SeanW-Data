<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
I’m a Junior Data Analyst focused on transforming business data into clear, actionable insights. 
I specialise in <strong>Power BI dashboard development</strong> and <strong>SQL-based exploratory data analysis</strong>, 
with an emphasis on performance reporting, KPI tracking, and commercial decision support.
</p>

<p>
My experience includes building end-to-end reporting workflows — from data cleaning and modelling 
(Power Query, star schema design) through to DAX measure development and executive-ready dashboards. 
I’ve worked with structured datasets ranging from 10k–100k+ records to analyse revenue performance, 
customer behaviour, and operational trends.
</p>

<p>
Before transitioning into analytics, I ran my own business for several years, using structured KPI tracking, 
forecasting, and performance analysis to drive approximately <strong>20% year-on-year profit growth</strong>. 
This commercial foundation shapes the way I approach analytics — practical, outcome-focused, and aligned with real business objectives.
