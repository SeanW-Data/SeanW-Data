## 🚀 About Me 
I’m an aspiring <strong>Data Analyst / Junior MI Analyst</strong> with a strong focus on using data to support clear, practical business decisions. I enjoy working with raw, imperfect datasets and turning them into structured insights that help teams understand performance, identify risks, and prioritise opportunities.

My core strengths are in <strong>Power BI, SQL, data modelling, and DAX</strong>, with experience delivering end-to-end analytics projects — from data cleaning in Power Query through to executive-level dashboards and actionable recommendations. I’m particularly interested in customer behaviour, pricing and value analysis, and operational performance.

Before moving fully into analytics, I ran my own business for several years, using data to track KPIs, analyse seasonality, and optimise marketing spend. This gave me a strong commercial mindset and an appreciation for reporting that is accurate, clear, and genuinely useful to decision-makers.

I’ve recently completed a <strong>Level 3 Diploma in Data Analytics</strong> with Power BI, reflecting a deliberate and motivated transition into a data analytics career. I’m actively building a portfolio that demonstrates real-world analytical thinking, practical problem-solving, and clear communication of insights.
