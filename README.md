## 🚀 About Me 
I’m an aspiring data analyst with a strong interest in using data to support better business decisions. I enjoy taking raw, imperfect datasets and turning them into clear insights that help teams understand performance, identify risks, and spot opportunities.

My work focuses on building practical dashboards that answer real business questions, writing efficient SQL for exploration and validation, and creating analytical models that support planning and decision-making. I’m particularly interested in pricing analysis, customer behaviour, and translating complex findings into insights that stakeholders can act on.

Outside of analytics, I enjoy reading, travelling, going to the gym, and gardening. I’m motivated by curiosity and the “eureka” moments that come from uncovering patterns or validating assumptions through data.
